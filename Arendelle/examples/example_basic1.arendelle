// This is a source code! Like
// what you see in movies with
// green colors and scary looks
// but codes are pretty and fun.
// You can create so many great
// things with them! Look at
// everything around you. All
// of them are somehow related
// to a software!
//
// Arendelle Language is a new
// simple langauge that shows
// you how to think like coders
// while you make cool drawings
// like the text you see here
// "BASIC 1" which was written
// by Arendelle!
//
// If you have our book you
// no longer need to read this
//

// You should know about five
// commands you saw in the
// opening of this app. They
// were 'r', 'd', 'l', 'u' and
// 'p'. You could use them to
// write :
//
//             █
//              █
//            ███
//
// Now imagine you're willing
// to write this:
//
//       █ █ █ █ █ █ █ █
//
// How you can code it? You may
// write:
//
//       prr prr prr prr
//       prr prr prr prr
//
// Right? So you see you have
// repeated 'prr' for 8 times
// and you may agree with me if
// there was a way to repeat an
// action, We could do this so
// much faster and easier, So
// yes sure, We have something
// that helps you do this, It's
// called a loop! It has a rule
// like this:
//
//      [ number , code ]
//
// What you do is simple. You
// write how much you want it
// to repeat as number and the
// code is obvious. So in our
// case we must write the code:
//
//         [ 8 , prr ]
//
// So now imagine we want to
// write this:
//
//            █
//             █
//              █
//               █
//
// So you may code it like:
//
//        prd prd prd prd 
//
// But you also know now that
// you can code it like this:
// 
//         [ 4 , prd ]
//
// You see you just learned
// your first real programming
// thing!
//
// The lines starting with //
// are called comment and they
// wont run. However a line
// without it will be run so if
// you push the run button
// right now you will see this
// code running:
//

     [ 4 , prd ] [ 5 , pru ]

//
// Can you imagine what it
// will be before you start it?
